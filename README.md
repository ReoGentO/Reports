# REPORTS

### What is this?

- This is a reporting plugin for the Minecraft server.

### You'd think there's a lot of plugins like that!

- Yes, there are plenty of such plugins on the Internet, but mine is different in that it has a tracking system and good customization!

### Wow! I'll go download it!

- You can download it [here](https://rubukkit.org/threads/sec-reports-v0-5b-reporty-s-sistemoj-nabljudenija-1-16-1-19.194459/). The plugin is currently only on the Russian Bukkit website, and a transition to Spigot is planned soon.
